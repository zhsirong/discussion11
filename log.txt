###Final Epic
##Previous Commits – A Brief Recap
Michael Hess, beloved professor of SI 504, was brutally attacked during a stormy afternoon by a former student, Elijah, who had long vowed revenge after failing the final exam.

The instructional team was wiped out.

But not before Michael whispered one final prophecy:

“My students… will solve this murder… with shell, with server, and with git…”

Driven by that last wish, the students of SI 504 launched Project RESTORE, tracked Elijah down using git blame, grep, commit hashes, and their collective coding prowess.

Justice was served.

The spirit of 504 lived on.

Or so they thought…

It was a quiet afternoon. Snow drifted against the windows of the SI 504 lecture hall.
The class was gathered for a memorial read-aloud. On the wall hung a gilded portrait of Professor Hess, his gaze frozen in grayscale nobility.

Then, suddenly—

“Ahem.”

A soft voice.
A familiar voice.
From the back of the room, stepping out from behind the curtain…

Michael Hess. Alive.

Gasps filled the room. One student fainted onto a pile of sticky notes.

He walked slowly toward the blackboard, hands behind his back, the same way he always had before giving a final exam.

He pushed up his glasses.
