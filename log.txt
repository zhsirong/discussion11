###Final Epic
##Previous Commits – A Brief Recap
Michael Hess, beloved professor of SI 504, was brutally attacked during a stormy afternoon by a former student, Elijah, who had long vowed revenge after failing the final exam.
The instructional team was wiped out.
But not before Michael whispered one final prophecy:
“My students… will solve this murder… with shell, with server, and with git…”
Driven by that last wish, the students of SI 504 launched Project RESTORE, tracked Elijah down using git blame, grep, commit hashes, and their collective coding prowess.
Justice was served.
The spirit of 504 lived on.
Or so they thought…
##New Commit – michael_rebase_returns()
It was a quiet afternoon. Snow drifted against the windows of the SI 504 lecture hall.
The class was gathered for a memorial read-aloud. On the wall hung a gilded portrait of Professor Hess, his gaze frozen in grayscale nobility.
“Never left,” he said. “Not for vengeance. Not for regret.
504 spirit never dies.”
The room erupted.
Students screamed. Some wept. Others high-fived across the room.
A spontaneous standing ovation broke out. Someone yelled “merge conflict resolved!” and nobody even cringed.
“You tracked a murderer using git,” Michael continued, “I couldn’t be prouder.”
He gestured at the screen showing the team’s last pull request. A merge banner read:
✔️ 504answer merged into main.
Then, suddenly—
“Ahem.”
A soft voice.
A familiar voice.
From the back of the room, stepping out from behind the curtain…
Michael Hess. Alive.
Gasps filled the room. One student fainted onto a pile of sticky notes.
He walked slowly toward the blackboard, hands behind his back, the same way he always had before giving a final exam.
He pushed up his glasses.
##Final Twist – grade-weight-adjustment()
The class erupts into a victorious roar. A spontaneous terminal opens.
Someone types:
git commit -m "Final boss rebase: Michael returns"
Then, the Canvas tab refreshes.
A hush falls over the crowd.
Someone squints at their screen and mutters:
“Wait… my final grade says… 75.4%?”
Gasps. Echoing mouse clicks. A chorus of refreshed tabs.
Attendance: 40.54%
Assignments: 96.25%
Exams: 41%
Final Assignment: Not Yet Graded
A chill runs down everyone’s spine.
The projector flickers once, dramatically.
Someone screams.
Michael smiled with that maddening professor-glint in his eye.
He picked up a piece of chalk and wrote on the board:
$ git commit -m "Life’s not always fair. But you always git push on."
A hush fell again.
Then, slowly, students nodded.
And they understood.
"You may fail a final. You may even lose a semester.
But if you know how to document, collaborate, and version your life—
you'll always be ready for the next commit."
"You may beat the system. You may outwit death.
But you'll never outscore Canvas grading."
